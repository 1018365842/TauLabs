task. h 
\begin{DoxyPre}void vTaskStartTrace( char * pcBuffer, unsigned portBASE\_TYPE uxBufferSize );\end{DoxyPre}


Starts a real time kernel activity trace. The trace logs the identity of which task is running when.

The trace file is stored in binary format. A separate D\-O\-S utility called convtrce.\-exe is used to convert this into a tab delimited text file which can be viewed and plotted in a spread sheet.


\begin{DoxyParams}{Parameters}
{\em pc\-Buffer} & The buffer into which the trace will be written.\\
\hline
{\em ul\-Buffer\-Size} & The size of pc\-Buffer in bytes. The trace will continue until either the buffer in full, or ul\-Task\-End\-Trace () is called. \\
\hline
\end{DoxyParams}
