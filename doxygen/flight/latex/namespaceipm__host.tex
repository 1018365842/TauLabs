Interactive Py\-Mite.  




\subsection{Detailed Description}
Interactive Py\-Mite. An interactive command line that runs on a host computer that is connected to a target device that is running Py\-Mite. The host computer compiles the interactive statement and converts it to a form that Py\-Mite can handle, sends that over the connection where the target device loads and interprets it. The target device then packages any result, sends it to the host computer and the host computer prints the result.
