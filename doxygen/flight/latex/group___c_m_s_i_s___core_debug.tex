Cortex-\/\-M0 Core Debug Registers (D\-C\-B registers, S\-H\-C\-S\-R, and D\-F\-S\-R) are only accessible over D\-A\-P and not via processor. Therefore they are not covered by the Cortex-\/\-M0 header file.

\subsection{Detailed Description}
Cortex-\/\-M0 Core Debug Registers (D\-C\-B registers, S\-H\-C\-S\-R, and D\-F\-S\-R) are only accessible over D\-A\-P and not via processor. Therefore they are not covered by the Cortex-\/\-M0 header file. S\-C000 Core Debug Registers (D\-C\-B registers, S\-H\-C\-S\-R, and D\-F\-S\-R) are only accessible over D\-A\-P and not via processor. Therefore they are not covered by the Cortex-\/\-M0 header file.

Type definitions for the Core Debug Registers.

Cortex-\/\-M0+ Core Debug Registers (D\-C\-B registers, S\-H\-C\-S\-R, and D\-F\-S\-R) are only accessible over D\-A\-P and not via processor. Therefore they are not covered by the Cortex-\/\-M0 header file.
